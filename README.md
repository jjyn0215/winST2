# winST2 - SmartThings PC APP
A simple windows application for SmartThings

## Why did you make this?
Offical SmartThings Desktop is great, but it doesn't have functions that I want

Such as : Shortcut key, Quick access, low ram usage, etc

So I decided to make my own application, using [WPF UI](https://github.com/lepoco/wpfui).

## Functions
- Basic device on/off
- Polling rate is 5 sec
- Works on background
- Shortcut control ( Sooon )
  
## How to use
#### Set SmartThings API Token at settings page
> If you don't have ST Token, you can get [HERE](https://account.smartthings.com/tokens)

## Todo
Shortcut | X

Device Icon | V

Device Property (sensor, others...) | V

Tray UI | X
