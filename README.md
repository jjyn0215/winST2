# winST2
A simple windows application for SmartThings

## Why did you make this?
Official SmartThings Desktop has some lack of functions

Here's my previous winST : https://github.com/jjyn0215/winST.git

## Functions
- Basic device on/off
- Polling rate is 5 sec
- Works on background
- Shortcut control ( Sooon )
  
## How to use
#### Set SmartThings API Token at settings page
> If you don't have ST Token, you can get [HERE](https://account.smartthings.com/tokens)

## Todo
Shortcut | X

Device Icon | V

Device Property (sensor, others...) | V

Tray UI | X
